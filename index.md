# Who am I
* **Daytime:** Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Iowa State University (birth place of the[ first digital electronic computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_computer)), USA
* **Nighttime**: AI and hardware entrepreneur. 
I am a co-founder of two seed-stage startups of my students. Previously I had two failed hardware startups, one on augmented reality and the other on an object-tracking camera. I also sometimes build hobby PCBs. 
* I have a Chinese name: 鮑盛 and I emigrated to the US from China at 21. 
* I got my PhD in Computer Science with a minor in Eletrical Engineering from Texas Tech University. 
* Oh, I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) and [YouTube (in Chinese)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWYdVAxYCjEo4OPi3COk-A).
