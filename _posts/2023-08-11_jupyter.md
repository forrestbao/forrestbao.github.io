I have begun my journey to hack into Jupyter. The first step is to understand how to send code to a Jupyter kernel and get the results back. 

# Preparation

I have Jupyter on my computer for sure. I first start a Jupyter server from my Linux terminal. 

```sh
$ jupyter notebook
[I 11:23:19.415 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/forrest/repos/Funix/funix
[I 11:23:19.415 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8 is running at:
[I 11:23:19.415 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=94d64e081a9423e301059714ec73b60842d26380ad1e2fae
[I 11:23:19.415 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=94d64e081a9423e301059714ec73b60842d26380ad1e2fae
```

## Start a kernel

Then I start a kernel. I used httpie for simplicity from my Linux terminal.  

```sh
$ http POST localhost:8888/api/kernels?token=94d64e081a9423e301059714ec73b60842d26380ad1e2fae 
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                               
{
    "connections": 0,
    "execution_state": "starting",
    "id": "107dcac0-3cdf-423f-ab89-c014e3657192",
    "last_activity": "2023-08-11T16:25:38.650084Z",
    "name": "python3"
}
```

The kernel ID is important because that's where I will send code for execution. 

## Sending the code 
Next, I will send the code for execution. [Here is a post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54475896/interact-with-jupyter-notebooks-via-api) I found helpful.
